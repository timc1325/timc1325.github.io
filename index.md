## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCSD, specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science. Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and obtained a Master's degree in Applied Statistics from UCLA in 2024. My research involves designing efficient, privacy-preserving machine learning methods by optimizing large-scale model inference with compression, parallelism, and cryptographic verification techniques.
